# Lint Fixes Applied for Phase 6

This document tracks the linting issues that need to be resolved for production readiness.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Unused Imports and Variables
- Removed unused `useAuth` import from auth/callback/page.tsx
- Removed unused UI component imports from talent/opportunities/page.tsx
- Removed unused icon imports from talent/apply/[opportunityId]/page.tsx

### 2. TypeScript Type Safety
- Fixed `any` type usage in setPaymentMethod to specific union type
- Added proper type assertions for method.id

### 3. HTML Entity Encoding
- Need to replace unescaped quotes with proper HTML entities
- Replace `'` with `&rsquo;` or `&apos;`
- Replace `"` with `&ldquo;` and `&rdquo;`

## Remaining Issues to Address

### High Priority (Build Blockers)
- None - build passes successfully

### Medium Priority (Code Quality)
- Multiple unused variables across components
- Missing dependency warnings in useEffect hooks
- TypeScript `any` types that should be more specific

### Low Priority (Style/Convention)
- Image optimization warnings (using `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image>`)
- HTML entity escaping for quotes

## Recommended Actions

1. **For Production**: Address all high and medium priority issues
2. **For Development**: Low priority issues can be addressed incrementally
3. **For Maintenance**: Set up pre-commit hooks to prevent future linting issues

## ESLint Configuration

Consider updating `.eslintrc.json` to:
- Allow unused variables starting with `_` (e.g., `_error`)
- Reduce severity of image optimization warnings for development
- Configure proper rules for HTML entities in JSX
